Take care with automated generators, they generate HPL.dat
files, here we use hpl.conf, just the name is different.

If you use atlas library don't edit lines 11 and 12. Still launch with
mpirun -np 1 xhpl (atlas library is compiled with lpthread option, so it
dispatch itself processes on threads).

Edit hpl.conf at lines 11 and 12 (just if you use blas library):

  Ps x Qs must be equal to the number of available threads
  i.e. 8 threads on Core I7 you can use:

  1    Ps
  8    Qs

  or

  2    Ps
  4    Qs

  etc...

If you get more than 2GB memory multiply by 100 Ns value at line 6:

  12800    Ns

Then launch with (just if you use blas library):

  mpirun -np <num_threads> xhpl

and wait...
